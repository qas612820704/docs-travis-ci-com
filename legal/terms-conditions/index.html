The customer will provide Travis CI with his GitHub account information (hereinafter “GitHub Sign-In”) when signing in through GitHub via travis CI-ci.com (hereinafter the “Website”) automatically. He allows Travis CI to access the customer’s GitHub account. Travis CI will directly communicate in the name of the customer with GitHub and the customer authorizes Travis CI to act on his behalf towards GitHub Inc. The customer is solely liable for any costs or damages that GitHub Inc. associates with the GitHub Sign-In.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="scope-of-services">Scope of services</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Travis CI provides Travis CI as a service. This means, that Travis CI may be used via the internet only.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>make precise and correct allegations and to correct the data if changes accrue;</li>
      <li>keep Account Data confidential at all times and to do everything to avoid any third party getting hold of the data. In this respect ‘third party’ also includes all employees of the customer that are not designated to use Travis CI;</li>

  <li>The customer will indemnify and hold harmless Travis CI, its officers and directors, employees and agents from any and all third party claims, damages, costs and (including reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of the customer’s use of Travis CI in a manner not authorized by this Agreement, and/or applicable law, or the customer’s or it’s employees’ or personnel’s negligence or willful misconduct.</li>
</ol>
